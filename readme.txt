Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This Python script is all about recognizing handwritten digits using a cool technique 
called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). 
It's like breaking down each digit's style into mathematical building blocks, 
then using them to figure out what number it is. 
Super neat!

How it Works:
First off, we treat the handwritten digits as 16x16 grids, kind of like tiny pictures.
Then, we use SVD to find these special building blocks that represent the unique features of each digit.
It's like finding the most important parts of each digit and using them to recognize others.
This script assumes that each digit has its own special set of features that can help identify it.
Using the Script:
You'll need some Python basics and the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Colorama libraries installed.
Just run the script, and it'll take care of everything, from reading the data to 
testing the accuracy of digit recognition.

Requirements:

Python (obviously!)
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Colorama

Data:
Inside the 'Data_Inside.zib' there is the required data just copy the contense next to the usps.ipynb file. 
You'll find all the training and testing data in CSV format inside 
the 'USPS Digits' directory.

Output:
At the end of it all, you'll get a report on how well the script did in 
identifying each digit from 0 to 9.
